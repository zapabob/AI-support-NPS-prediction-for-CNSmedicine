# Motivation

I have a strong interest in the fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and chemistry. The development of new drug discovery processes utilizing AI technology is one of the major challenges in the medical field, and I aim to tackle this challenge.

Compound activity prediction is a crucial process in the early stages of drug discovery, but there are limitations to conventional experimental methods. I strive to build a more precise and efficient activity prediction system by leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as machine learning and graph theory.

In this project, we use machine learning models like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Random Forests to predict the activity values (pIC50) of compounds from their SMILES or IUPAC names. Furthermore, we aim to improve prediction accuracy by utilizing features obtained from quantum chemistry calculations, such as electron densities.

Through this project, I aspire to acquire state-of-the-art knowledge and skills in the fusion of AI and chemistry. In the future, I hope to contribute to the development of new drug discovery methods and drug design by leveraging the outcomes of this project.

I am confident that my abilities and experience will be enhanced through my involvement in this project. I sincerely request your guidance and support.
