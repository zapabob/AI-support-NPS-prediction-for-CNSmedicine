# Motivation
 Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various domains, and its synergy with computational chemistry holds immense potential for accelerating drug discovery processes. Conventional experimental techniques for predicting compound-target interactions and quantifying bioactivities have inherent limitations, prompting us to develop more precise and efficient in silico prediction systems by leveraging cutting-edge technologies like machine learning and graph theory.

 This project aims to develop a drug discovery support platform based on the ligand-agonist paradigm, employing machine learning models such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Random Forests. Our primary objective is to accurately predict bioactivity metrics, including pIC50 and IC50 values, for compounds represented by their SMILES or IUPAC nomenclature, enhanced by incorporating quantum chemical descriptors like electron densities and molecular orbital energies.

 While our initial focus is on exploring potential therapeutic candidates for neuropsychiatric disorders like PTSD, ASD, ADHD, fibromyalgia, and chronic pain conditions, our ultimate goal is to investigate psychoactive compounds that can modulate sensory perception in augmented and virtual reality environments. We hypothesize that psychedelics and related psychoplastogens hold promise in enhancing multi-sensory integration, expanding the boundaries of human perception, and facilitating novel states of consciousness exploration.

 Through this interdisciplinary project, we aspire to acquire state-of-the-art knowledge and expertise in the convergence of AI, computational chemistry, and psychedelic science. By leveraging the outcomes of this work, we hope to contribute to the development of novel drug discovery pipelines, rational drug design strategies, and the exploration of consciousness-altering substances for therapeutic and experiential purposes.

 To achieve a top-ranking position in the AI hackathon, we will strive to develop a robust and accurate predictive model, backed by comprehensive documentation and an effective presentation. We are confident that our dedication and the synergistic approach of integrating multiple disciplines will enhance our abilities and experiences, paving the way for future contributions to this exciting and rapidly evolving field.

 We sincerely seek your guidance and support as we embark on this ambitious journey, merging AI, computational chemistry, psychedelic science, and the exploration of human consciousness.
